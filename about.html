    <p class="fst-normal justify-content-end mb-3 p-5 my-5">ChildcareCenter is the foremost destination online for
        qualified,
        family-friendly childcare
        centers across
        . We are the largest directory for childcare services in the nation, with over 250,000
        childcare centers, home daycare providers, nannies, and babysitters to give you the best choices possible for
        your child’s care.
        <br>
        Created in 2009, ChildcareCenter.us was designed to be a helpful and friendly resource for parents in search of
        safe and reliable childcare services for their children. The creators of this company are parents themselves and
        understand firsthand just how difficult, time-consuming, and expensive searching for acceptable child care can
        be.
        <br>
        ChildcareCenter.us aims to make the process the exact opposite – quick, convenient, and free. Parents may browse
        through over 250,000 listings and not only find childcare providers, but also obtain access to informative
        reviews from other parents. All of this is in an effort to give you something other directory services do not
        provide – information about childcare providers that is complete, thorough, and free of charge.
        <br>
        Providers also benefit by updating their services and qualifications on the directory for free, allowing them
        exposure to over 500,000 visitors per month who are searching for the best in affordable and responsible child
        care.
